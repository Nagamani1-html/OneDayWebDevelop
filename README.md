PROJECT DESCRIPTION
A food bank website serves as a digital hub that connects those in need with essential resources and support, streamlining the process to access food aid. 
Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how it typically works:
 Donation and Volunteering Opportunities: For those looking to support, the site provides options to donate money, food, or time. Clear donation links, wish lists, and volunteer 
   sign-up forms engage the community and help maintain a steady flow of resources.
